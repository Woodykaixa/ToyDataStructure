# ToyDataStructure
My implementation of some data structures. Most of them are used to complete the homework of Data Structure & Algorithm Course(STL is forbidden, but C++ standard is not limited). 词穷了，英文⑧会说了。反正就是费时间写了这个东西，课要结束了但是删了又有点可惜。不如传到GitHub上，然后本地删掉。

## Bugs

These codes are written for three exercises and some classes are not so compatible.(For example, Huffman.h cannot pass the compilation)
