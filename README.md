# ToyDataStructure
My implementation of some data structures. 


## Note
Most of them are used to complete the homework of Data Structure & Algorithm Course(STL is forbidden, but C++ standard is not limited). 

For pleasure, I will update this repo when I'm free.

## Bugs

These codes are written for three exercises and some classes are not so compatible.(For example, Huffman.h cannot pass the compilation)


## Todo

+ Rewrite `Huffman.h`


## In progress

+ AVL Tree
